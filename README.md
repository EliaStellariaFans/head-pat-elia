# Head Pat Elia

A website where you can give [Elia Stellaria](https://twitter.com/EliaStellaria) head pats and she says things in return.

## Developing the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note that the chibi images used by the app are not included in the repo to avoid distributing them since Elia has only
made them available in her members folder. You can contact Nick22 on the [KAME Fans discord](https://discord.gg/kamebuddies)
to get your Elia membership verified and get the chibi images needed for the app.

#### `npm start`
